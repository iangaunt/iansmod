# iansmod: Modding Minecraft with Forge

This repository contains my experience with modding Minecraft for 1.18.2 (I would have preferred to use 1.16.5,
but unfortunately the MDK had shit the bed and wasn't working very well for me).

## Current Features

* None at the moment.

## Future Features

* Some new ores and armor.
* Some new block textures.
* Anything I'm feeling, really!
