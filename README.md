# iansmod: Modding Minecraft with Forge

This repository contains my experience with modding Minecraft for 1.18.2 (I would have preferred to use 1.16.5,
but unfortunately the MDK had shit the bed and wasn't working very well for me).

## Current Features

* Lunarium Items (Ingots, Tools, Ores)
* Wengewood wood type (Darker, desaturated spruce color)
* Music Disc - REBOUND! by JPEGMAFIA

## Future Features

* Wengewood Trees
* More Lunaris tools and armor.
* New ore types.
* Anything I'm feeling, really!
